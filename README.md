Algorithmic trading, or automated trading, employs computer algorithms to execute trades
in financial markets. Enabled by high-speed computers and advanced data analysis tools,
it has grown in popularity. This method allows for faster, more efficient trade execution
compared to manual trading. By using pre-defined rules, algorithmic trading minimizes
human error and emotion-based decision making, while reducing transaction costs.
Common algorithmic trading strategies include trend following, mean reversion, statistical
arbitrage, and market-making. Machine learning algorithms and advanced data analysis
tools are often employed to train strategies using historical market data, identifying patterns
and trends for future predictions.
Algorithmic trading has significantly impacted the financial industry, but it also presents
potential risks and challenges, such as programming errors and market volatility exacerbation.
Despite this, algorithmic trading will likely continue to be an essential aspect of the financial
industry as technology evolves and new data analysis tools emerge.
The objective is to develop an machine learning driven algorithmic trading model to
optimize returns and risk management for foreign exchange. The algorithm employed varies
from linear model to logistic regression and then further deep dive by using neural networks.
The models are trained on technical indicators to predict the direction and magnitude of
index movements.
The performance of the predictive models is evaluated using different performance metrics
such as cross-validation, confusion matrix, risk-adjusted returns, out-of-sample testing based
on train-test split data. The goal is to determine if the machine learning approach can
identify opportunities to outperform the market and utilise risk management strategies
more effectively. The ensemble of classifiers/regressor/neural networks aims to improve the
predictive power and robustness of the resulting machine learning algorithmic trading bot.
